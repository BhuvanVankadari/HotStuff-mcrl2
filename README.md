# Model Initialization Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for running the model using `mCRL2`. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the model effectively.

## Steps to Run the Model

1. **Choose the Number of Faulty Replicas (F)**:
   - Determine the number of faulty replicas (F) you want to simulate. This value represents the number of replicas that may fail or behave incorrectly.

2. **Choose the Number of Replicas (N)**:
   - Set the total number of replicas (N). Ensure that `N` satisfies the condition `N >= 3F + 1`.
   - This condition ensures the model can tolerate up to F faulty replicas and still function correctly.

3. **Choose the Number of Views**:
   - Decide on the number of views you want to use. Ensure that the command list has more elements than the number of views.

4. **Initialize the Corresponding Number of Replicas**:
   - Create and initialize N replicas. Each replica must have a unique ID.
   - Start the IDs at 1 and increment by 1 for each new replica (IDs will range from 1 to N).

5. **Change the Number of Multi-actions**:
   - Adjust the number of multi-actions to match the total number of replicas (N).
   - Ensure that each replica has the correct number of actions corresponding to its ID.
